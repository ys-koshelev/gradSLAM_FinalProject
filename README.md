# gradSLAM_FinalProject
Repo with our gradSLAM realization as a final project for Perception In Robotics 2020 course at Skoltech

## Grad Levenbergâ€“Marquardt branch:
Look into LM.py for base classes and solver. Look into test_exp.py and test_sin.py to investigate realization of basic 
functions fitting (exp and sin correspondingly). To see how it works, just do:

python test_exp.py

python test_sin.py

## Data
